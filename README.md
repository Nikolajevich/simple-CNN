## A Simple Convolutional Neural Network

------------------------------------------

#### This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented from scratch using TensorFlow and Numpy. 

#### The network is designed to perform image classification on the MNIST dataset.

#### The network is made of two convolutional layers with maxpooling and one fully connected layer.
